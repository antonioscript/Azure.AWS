Azure.AWS is a comparative guide that highlights the key differences and similarities between Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS)

# Compare AWS and Azure accounts

## Managing account hierarchy

A typical AWS environment uses an organizational structure like the one in the following diagram. There's an **organization** root and optionally a dedicated AWS **management account**. Below the root are **organizational units** that can be used to apply different policies to different accounts. AWS resources often use an AWS account as a logical and billing boundary.

- **Organization**
- **Organization Units**
- **AWS accounts**
- **Resources**

An Azure structure looks similar, but, rather than a dedicated management account, it provides administrative permissions on the **tenant**. This design eliminates the need for an entire account just for management. Unlike AWS, Azure uses **resource groups** as a fundamental unit. Resources must be assigned to resource groups, and permissions can be applied at the resource-group level.

- **Tenant**
- **Management Groups**
- **Subscriptions**
- **Resources**

## AWS management account vs. Azure tenant

In Azure, when you create an Azure account, a **Microsoft Entra tenant** is created. You can manage your users, groups, and applications in this **tenant**. Azure subscriptions are created under the tenant. A Microsoft Entra tenant provides identity and access management. It helps ensure that authenticated and authorized users can access only the resources for which they have permissions.â€¯
